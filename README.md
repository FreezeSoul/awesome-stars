- [IDASimulator](https://github.com/nihilus/IDASimulator) - IDASimulator is a plugin that extends IDA's conditional breakpoint support, making it easy to augment / replace complex executable code inside a debugged process with Python code.

With support for multiple target architectures, it handles details such as register initialization, memory allocation, pointers, function arguments and return values seamlessly and transparently, making it easy to replace, modify and subvert existing functionality (or lack thereof) in the target process. IDASimulator also includes the IDASim python module, on which IDASimulator is based. This allows for all of the features of IDASimulator to be integrated into more complex IDAPython scripts. IDASimulator currently supports the x86, x86_64, ARM and MIPS32 architectures. Porting to other architectures is very easy.
